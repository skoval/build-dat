Build-dat
======

The goal of **Build-dat** is to bring the latest data product, data visualization, and web application tools to researchers at the RAND Corporation. **Build-dat** is about learning through doing. Each **Build-dat** event will focus on one particular tool and attendees will get a hands-on introduction to its use through short demos of real-world applications presented by colleagues at RAND.
