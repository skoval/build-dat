Build-dat Demos
======

The goal of **Build-dat Demos** is to be an incubator for the latest tools for data products, data visualizations, and web applications that have the potential to advance research at RAND. **Build-dat** is about learning through doing. Each **Build-dat** event will focus on one particular tool and attendees will get a hands-on introduction to its use through short demos of real-world applications presented by colleagues at RAND.
